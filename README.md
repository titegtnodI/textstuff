textstuff
=========

I've modified insaneKane's text stuff he has for the 3DS, but I made it work for ctrulib. I've also added in more character support like .,:!?1234567890, fixed bugs, and cleaned it up a bit (with more cleaning to come).

Setup

1. Just follow the instructions to setup your development environment here: http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment
2. Copy or link "letters.h", "memory.h", and "memory.c" to example/source.
3. Go ahead and compile the example.
